- 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler Bikaun (@4theKnowledge)
- 👀 I’m interested in developing applications to support natural language processing (NLP) and knowledge graph construction (as well as other odd things!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graph visualisation and generative language modelling.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NLP and graph annotation software.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my software or want to collaborate - tylerbikaun@gmail.com
